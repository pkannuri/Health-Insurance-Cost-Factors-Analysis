# Health Insurance Cost Factors Analysis
Investigated various factors influencing health insurance costs for US residents

## Project Description
This Tableau-driven Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project investigates various factors influencing health insurance costs for US residents, such as preexisting medical conditions, dietary habits, and lifestyle choices. Our goal is to aid insurance providers in setting premiums, establishing reserve funds, and creating detailed risk profiles for individual policyholders.

## Key Objectives
- **Identify Critical Factors:** Determine which health and lifestyle attributes correlate with higher insurance premiums.
- **Support Insurance Providers:** Assist in the formulation of premium structures and reserve funds based on detailed risk profiles.
- **Promote Informed Decision-Making:** Provide actionable insights that can influence policy pricing and customer engagement strategies.

## Tableau Visualization
Utilizing Tableau, we developed interactive dashboards that highlight the relationship between lifestyle choices and insurance costs. These visualizations help in understanding how different factors such as diet, exercise, and preexisting conditions impact premium costs across various demographics.

### Main Features
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Explore data through filters and drill-down capabilities to understand the depth and nuances of insurance cost drivers.
- **Comparative Analysis:** View comparisons across different states and demographics to identify patterns and outliers in insurance pricing.
- **Predictive Insights:** Use historical data to forecast trends and potential future impacts on insurance costs.

## Data Sources
The analysis is based on multiple datasets, including:
- **US Health Insurance Dataset:** Contains demographic and health-related attributes of insured individuals.
- **Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Prediction Dataset:** Focuses on lifestyle factors that influence cardiovascular health.
- **US CDC Obesity Prevalence Data:** Tracks obesity rates across various regions, providing insight into health trends and their implications for insurance costs.
